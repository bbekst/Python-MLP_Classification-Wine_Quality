# Python-MLP_Classification-Wine_Quality
In this machine learning project, we employed a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to classify wine quality, implementing it in Python. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, comprised 1,599 instances of preprocessed physiochemical properties such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, and alcohol content. During the model's training and testing, we conducted experiments with three parameter combinations, adjusting the learning rate, hidden layers, and activation function. Model evaluation involved diverse metrics—classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, harmonic mean, and logarithmic loss—calculated using Scikit-Learn. Additionally, ROC curves were visualized with the matplotlib library. The analysis revealed nuanced performance variations across parameter combinations, with the area under the curve ranging from 85% to 87% in the training dataset and 81% to 85% in the test dataset. These insights offer a comprehensive understanding of the MLP model's effectiveness under different configurations.
